 <p>> I am Chris Kautz-Scanavy and I am training to become a junior full stack developer. I have done quite a few things 
since graduating college amost 19 years ago. After college I moved to Richmond as that is where my band was located 
and Richmond had a good music scene in the early 2000's.  Playing doesn't pay the bills, so I became a beerman.  Now 
that was fun,  driving a big ass beer truck with 60 kegs plus, selling and delivering them.  I mean I was the beerman...
then my back said screw you, your beerman days are over. time to do something else.</p>

<p>I was a sub teacher briefly and this was while recovering from a back injury and a rebuilt knee. So natuarlly it was 
time to do outside MRO sales, nuts bolts, mechanical related stuff, and industrial chemicals.   The outside sales wasn't 
thing that seemed like a great a fit in the MRO industry.   Most of these products could be purchased locally from the a 
hardware, or some variation of the products.  This is when I decided to join corporate American and work in downtown 
Richmond doing inside sales for a car dealer lead generation company.    I eventually made a transition while at the same 
company to the Marketing dept at the same company.   I have been in the online marketing industry for 14 years.  That is 
a long time, and it is now time for me to build upon the knowledge and experience to really grow my professional skillsets 
and become a full stack developer. Bam!  Like I dropped a mic, well not really.
